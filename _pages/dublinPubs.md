So basically myself and my brother are attempting to drink in every pub in Dublin. The rules are
  
  * We both have to be in the pub together
  * We both have to be drinking alcohol
  * It has to be a pub, no hotels or airports or any of that shite
  * If they refuse to show a Pats game they are struck from the list... Fuck you Doyles...

Below is a map of the current pubs that we've managed to do. Lots more to do... :beers: :beers: :beers: :tropical_drink: :pizza: :sleeping:
