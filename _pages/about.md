Hello, 你好, Dia dhuit,    
The name's Brian Mooney. I'm a father (very proud one), a husband (probably a lousy one), a drunk and a software developer. My passions include following [St. Pats] and generally anything geeky. I'm a Dub living in Kildare and I'm ok with that.

Currently I work for [Paddy Power], or '*Paddy Power Betfair*' as they like to be called now, as an application engineer in their Business Trading Systems team. This has mostly involved working with both Java and Scala for the last few years although in my spare time I like to experiment a little with [Rust].

Home brewing is one of my hobbies and the rest of my free time is spent with my three wonderful kids. They're slowly driving me mad, but I love it... :grinning:
