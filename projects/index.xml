      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved music. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing guitar for 20 odd years. I&amp;rsquo;m still shit at it, but I love it none the less. Now that my kids are showing an interest in music as well, it has somewhat rekindled my passion. I attempt recordings every now and again. These can be found on soundcloud. There&amp;rsquo;s an examples below, it&amp;rsquo;s very much amateur-hour hobby shit but it&amp;rsquo;s still fun.
To be honest, I get very little time to dedicate to trying to get a good recording.</description>

      <description>On dislay in my house is the fruit of several years of foraging. Beer bottles from around the world. Each drank by myself and each with their own story. See the collection below.
Name Brand Style Description Taedonggang Taedonggang Brewing Company Lager This was the most difficult bottle to get by far. It&amp;#39;s from a brewery in North Korea and it needed to be shipped to Ireland via a hop in China (the only country the brewery deals with).</description>

      <description>I work as a software engineer and I like my job. I get to learn a lot and work on projects that are at a large enough scale to be really interesting. I also get to mentor junior engineers, and that&amp;rsquo;s something I really enjoy doing. I&amp;rsquo;d be nowhere near where I am now professionally if not for all the incredibly smart people that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with throughout the years. Although, my job is satisfying, I still feel like the skills have a fairly narrow scope.</description>
