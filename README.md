# My Personal Site/Blog

This site basically started out by me being bored and wanting to play with github pages. I'll
try and keep it up todate with information about any projects that I'm working on for more than
two minutes on GitHub and anything else which crosses my mind... :)


## Attributions
The site is based off of this template [Jekyll Uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) because I'm fuckin useless at any kind of design or prettyness.
