I've wanted to do a proper family tree for years so I finally decided to do it. It is primarily aimed at the kids and as such will feature both my side and Lings family. Most of the actual research is done at this stage and I've started trying to put what detail I have into a book so that it won't just get lost in the bowels of the internet. I want to document here, the tools and resources that I used and also some of the difficulties that actually presented themselves.
